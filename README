Joins two MAFs files based on a tree and one common reference genome shared
between the two MAFs.  Allows for duplications in the MAF.


Algorithm:
  - Input is two MAFs, A and B, and a single common reference organism c in
    both MAFs.

  - Construct a map mA that maps each base position in the reference
    organism c to all columns containing it MAF A.  The contents of each
    column is a list of the (conceptual) tuple:

     (organism seqId position strand base)

  - Construct a map mB for MAF B for reference organism c.

  - Construct a join mA and mB to produce a map mAB that maps each base
    position in the reference organism c to the combined contents of the
    mafA and mafB for that position.

  - convert map mAB back to a new MAF N:
     - for each position pc in reference organism c:
        - if column associated with pc has not been written:
            - if the contents associated with pc can be used to extend
              the current MAF N block:
                - extend current MAF N
              else:
                - output current MAF N block
                - start a new MAF N block using current column
            - mark column in mAB as being written
